## Generate embeddings
``` sql
with scope as (
 select hash
 from commit_logs
 where embedding is null
 order by id
 limit 25
), upd as (
 update commit_logs
 set embedding = local_get_embedding(
   content := format(
     'Date: %s. Hash: %s. Message: %s',
     created_at,
     hash,
     message
   )
 )
 where hash in (
   select hash
   from scope
 )
 returning *
)
select
 count(embedding) as cnt_vectorized,
 max(upd.id) as latest_upd_id,
 round(
   max(upd.id)::numeric * 100 /
     (select max(c.id) from commit_logs as c),
   2
 )::text || '%' as progress,
 1 / count(*) as err_when_done
from upd;
\watch .1
```


## CREATE index on the embedding column
```bash
sudo -u postgres psql -d testdb -Xc "create index on commit_logs using hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);"
sudo -u postgres psql -d testdb -Xc "drop index  commit_logs_embedding_idx"
```

### Final working query 
```sql
select local_chat('Optimise numeric multiplication for short inputs. â€“ when, who, etc.');
```

## aditional query for test
```sql
select id, embedding from  commit_logs limit 5;

WITH generated_vector AS (
    SELECT local_get_embedding(content := 'commit with checksum that was create only 2024') AS q_vector
)
SELECT
    created_at,
    format(
        'https://gitlab.com/postgres/postgres/-/commit/%s',
        left(hash, 8)
    ),
    left(message, 150),
    authors,
    1 - (embedding <-> generated_vector.q_vector) as similarity
FROM commit_logs, generated_vector
ORDER BY embedding <-> generated_vector.q_vector
LIMIT 5;


SELECT ai_local_call(
    'Show me what i send to you',
    'Commit 1: checksum verification...',
    'llama3'
);

```
